This document outlines how that the administration of the server and governance over changes will be done.</p><p>The current server admin is <a href=https://garykim.dev>Gary Kim</a>.</p><h3 id=overview>Overview</h3><p>Governance is done in a fashion similar to the liberal contribution model used in open source software development. The general philosophy that we are using is that all opinions are worth considering. The server admin must not make changes to server configuration without a general consensus after an appropriate attempt to contact everyone who may be effected by a change.</p><p>Excerpt from <a href=https://opensource.guide/leadership-and-governance/>https://opensource.guide/leadership-and-governance/</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Liberal contribution: Under a liberal contribution model, the people who do the most work are recognized as most influential, but this is based on current work and not historic contributions. Major project decisions are made based on a consensus seeking process (discuss major grievances) rather than pure vote, and strive to include as many community perspectives as possible. Popular examples of projects that use a liberal contribution model include <a href=https://foundation.nodejs.org/>Node.js</a> and <a href=https://www.rust-lang.org/>Rust</a>.</p></blockquote><h3 id=goals>Goals</h3><p>The server attempts to be as vanilla as possible when it comes to gameplay for the most part. This means that even bugs are kept in the game.</p><h3 id=server-configuration>Server Configuration</h3><p>Server configuration changes can only be done through the process outlined in the <a href=#overview>overview</a>.</p><p>Except any changes required for the continued operation of the server (refer to <a href=#article-14-section-31>Article 14: Section 31</a>), no special treatment will be provided to configuration change proposals by the server administrator.</p><h3 id=server-maintenance>Server Maintenance</h3><p>A server requires maintenance and upkeep to continue running normally. This often involves occasional restarts. These restarts should be planned ahead of time and be posted on a status page ahead of time to allow players time to prepare. Currently, the status page used is <a href=https://status.garykim.dev>https://status.garykim.dev</a>.</p><h3 id=whitelist>Whitelist</h3><p>Refer to the <a href=/governance/whitelist/>whitelist documentation</a>.</p><h3 id=article-14-section-31>Article 14: Section 31</h3><blockquote><p>Re-read the charter: Article 14, Section 31. There are a few lines that make allowances for bending the rules during times of extraordinary threat.</p></blockquote><p><strong>- Harris from Star Trek: Enterprise</strong></p><p>Many sections of this document places responsibilities on the server administrator that slows down how quickly changes can be made. This is desirable in nearly all cases but becomes an issue if a change is required for one reason or another that requires immediate action.</p><p>In cases in which immediate action is required for the continued operation or upkeep of the server, the server admin may ignore the governance process and make any configuration changes or restarts they deem necessary until the server is running normally. The server admin must be able to explain their actions to the players at a later date if requested by any player.</p></section></div><footer id=footer><section class="split contact"></section></footer><div id=copyright><ul></ul></div></div><script src=/assets/js/bundle.js></script></body></html>
