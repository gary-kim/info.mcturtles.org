*Minecraft: Turtle Server* is a whitelist enabled survival server. A creative world is also available for working on collaborative design projects.

### The beginning

In the fall of 2019, a fellow turtle decided to create a singleplayer world. They played with a couple of their friends on LAN and began to build and develop the world.

After that day, the decision was made to put this on a permanent server. After this, slowly, more and more players were added and a fledgling world came to be.

### The Nether

The server began on version `1.14.4`. Because of this, once the Nether Update (`1.16`) came out, the nether was reset in order for us to be able to use the new Nether features.
